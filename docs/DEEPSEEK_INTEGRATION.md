# DeepSeek Integration Guide

## Overview

DeepSeek has been integrated into the Orchestrator as a specialized agent for advanced reasoning, algorithm analysis, and performance optimization. It uses an OpenAI-compatible API interface, making integration seamless.

## When DeepSeek is Activated

DeepSeek automatically joins the pipeline when requirements contain complexity indicators:

- **Keywords**: optimize, performance, algorithm, complex, architecture, scale, security, analyze, efficient, bottleneck
- **Complex Requirements**: Any task requiring deep algorithmic analysis or performance optimization

## Agent Workflow

### Standard Pipeline (Simple Tasks)
```
1. Claude (Analysis) â†’ 2. Claude (Planning) â†’ 3. Codex (Implementation) â†’ 4. Claude2 (Validation)
```

### Enhanced Pipeline (Complex Tasks with DeepSeek)
```

## Configuration

### Setting up DeepSeek API Key

1. **Via Dashboard**:
   - Navigate to Settings tab
   - Enter your DeepSeek API key in the designated field
   - Click "Save Settings"

2. **Via Environment**:
   ```bash
   export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```

3. **Via .env file**:
   ```
   DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

## Example Usage

### Algorithm Optimization Request
```
"Build an efficient algorithm to find the k most frequent elements in a large dataset"
```

**DeepSeek Analysis**:
- Recommends heap-based approach for O(n log k) complexity
- Suggests quickselect for O(n) average case
- Provides memory optimization strategies
- Includes parallel processing recommendations

### Architecture Analysis Request
```
"Design a scalable microservices architecture for real-time trading"
```

**DeepSeek Analysis**:
- Event-driven architecture with Kafka/RabbitMQ
- CQRS pattern for read/write separation
- Circuit breaker patterns for resilience
- Distributed caching strategies

## Output Format

DeepSeek provides structured analysis:

```json
{
  "analysis_complete": true,
  "optimizations": [
    "Use connection pooling for database",
    "Implement caching layer with Redis",
    "Add request rate limiting"
  ],
  "performance_metrics": {
    "time_complexity": "O(n log n)",
    "space_complexity": "O(n)",
    "bottlenecks": ["database queries", "external API calls"]
  },
  "security_recommendations": [
    "Add input validation",
    "Implement CSRF protection",
    "Use prepared statements"
  ],
  "architecture_decisions": {
    "pattern": "microservices",
    "communication": "async_messaging",
    "data_consistency": "eventual"
  }
}
```

## Integration with Other Agents

### Context Sharing
DeepSeek receives context from previous agents:
- Claude's strategic analysis
- Previous implementation attempts
- Validation results

### Output Usage
DeepSeek's analysis is used by:
- **Claude**: For refined planning based on deep analysis
- **Codex**: For optimized code generation
- **Claude2**: For validation criteria

## Monitoring DeepSeek

### In Dashboard
- Check AI Agents section for DeepSeek status
- View Agent Console for real-time logs
- Monitor task pipeline for DeepSeek involvement

### In Server Logs
Look for:
```
ðŸ§  DEEPSEEK: Starting advanced reasoning task...
âœ… DEEPSEEK: Analysis complete (2000 chars)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use for Complex Tasks**: DeepSeek excels at algorithmic and architectural challenges
2. **Provide Context**: Include performance requirements in your prompts
3. **Iterate**: Use DeepSeek's optimization suggestions for refinement
4. **Monitor Usage**: DeepSeek may have different rate limits than other APIs

## Troubleshooting

### No DeepSeek Activation
- Check if prompt contains complexity keywords
- Verify API key is configured
- Check server logs for errors

### API Errors
- Verify API key validity
- Check DeepSeek service status
- Review rate limits

### Fallback Behavior
If DeepSeek fails, the system:
1. Logs the error with full traceback
2. Falls back to simulation mode
3. Continues pipeline execution

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. Custom complexity detection rules
2. DeepSeek-specific task types
3. Performance benchmark integration
4. Code refactoring suggestions
5. Architecture diagram generation

### Alternative Agent Architectures
As mentioned, we may explore completely different approaches to agent collaboration:
- **Peer-to-peer messaging**: Direct agent communication
- **Shared knowledge base**: Central repository for all agents
- **Consensus mechanisms**: Multiple agents voting on solutions
- **Specialized pipelines**: Task-specific agent configurations
